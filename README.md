# OpenInfraKE-UG Community Content
This repository serves as the central space for the OpenInfra User Group Kenya (OpenInfraKE-UG) community.

Here, members can find everything they need to get started — from our mission and Code of Conduct to event notes, mentorship details, and contribution guidelines.

We’re an open, collaborative space built to help engineers, students, and enthusiasts learn, share, and contribute to global OpenInfra projects while growing the local ecosystem.
