# OpenInfra User Group Kenya - Code of Conduct

The OpenInfra User Group Kenya is part of the global OpenInfra Foundation community.
Our goal is to create a space where individuals and organizations can **learn, collaborate, and innovate** around open infrastructure technologies through meetups, mentorship, and proof-of-concepts (PoCs).

We follow the **OpenInfra Foundation Code of Conduct**, adapting it to reflect our local context and community safety standards.

# Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free, inclusive, and respectful experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, ethnicity, religion, or technical experience level.

We commit to promoting:

 - Respectful communication and behavior
 - Constructive collaboration
 - Diversity of thought and background
 - Privacy and safety in all community interactions

# Expected Behaviour

Community members are expected to:

 - Be **respectful** and **considerate** in all interactions
 - Use **inclusive language** and avoid personal attacks
 - Provide **constructive feedback**
 - Credit and **acknowledge contributions** fairly
 - **Respect privacy** — do not share others’ information without consent
 - Support a culture of **learning and collaboration** during PoCs and community projects

# Unacceptable Behaviour

Unacceptable behavior includes:

 - Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind
 - Insults, threats, or demeaning comments, in person or online
 - **Stalking, doxxing, or following members outside official channels**
 - Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
 - Sharing of explicit, political, or religious content unrelated to the community
 - Disrupting events, discussions, or meetings
 - Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern

We will not tolerate conduct that violates another member’s privacy, security, or comfort — whether physical or digital.

# Protecting Member Privacy and Anonymity

Recognizing that open communities can expose individuals to unwanted contact, we emphasize **privacy and digital safety** as part of our conduct:

 - Members are free to participate using **pseudonyms or professional aliases**.
 - Sharing of another member’s contact details, social handles, or photos **without explicit consent** is prohibited.
 - Members must not reach out, follow, or engage with others **outside community platforms** (Slack, GitHub, or event spaces) unless invited.
 - Any form of **doxxing, stalking, or non-consensual data sharing** will result in immediate action, including removal from the community and potential escalation to the OpenInfra Foundation.
 - Reports will be handled confidentially, and the reporter’s identity will not be disclosed without permission.

These guidelines ensure that all contributors — regardless of background — can safely collaborate, innovate, and learn.
